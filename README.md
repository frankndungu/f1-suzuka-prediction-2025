# Suzuka 2025 F1 Prediction Model

### Built for Fans. Backed by Data. Powered by [Otto.rentals](https://otto.rentals)

Welcome to Otto's open-source F1 prediction engine — a machine learning project designed to forecast race results, generate driver insights, and create Instagram/Twitter-ready graphics for Formula 1 fans.

This repo currently supports predictions for the Suzuka and Shanghai Grand Prix in 2025.

## What’s Inside

| Module                        | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `suzuka_f1.py`                | Full-featured simulator for the Suzuka GP. Uses a Random Forest model, historical data, custom heuristics, and outputs 7 social-ready plots. |
| `shanghai_f1.py`              | Predicts results for the Shanghai GP using Random Forest + team/driver embeddings. Includes fallback handling and grid simulation.           |
| `suzuka_2025_predictions.csv` | Ranked table of driver predictions with podium/points probabilities.                                                                         |
| `*.png` images                | Visual outputs (charts, comparisons, podiums) generated by the model for social sharing.                                                     |

## Why We Built This

Otto helps car rental businesses go digital. But we’re also car lovers at heart. So we built this to:

- Bring machine learning to Formula 1 race predictions
- Create visual, shareable insights for fans
- Showcase Otto’s technical chops and brand voice

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install fastf1 pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pillow
```

We recommend using a virtual environment (e.g. `venv` or `conda`) for clean installs.

## How to Use

### 1. Predict Suzuka GP

```bash
python suzuka_f1.py
```

Outputs:

- `suzuka_2025_race_prediction.png`: Full grid predictions w/ error bars
- `suzuka_2025_podium_probability.png`: Top podium chances
- `suzuka_2025_points_probability_social.png`: Points finish visual for IG
- `suzuka_2025_driver_comparison.png`: Head-to-head radar chart
- `suzuka_2025_grid_vs_prediction.png`: Quali vs prediction
- `suzuka_2025_team_performance.png`: Team-level performance
- `suzuka_2025_prediction_uncertainty.png`: Prediction risk vs confidence
- `suzuka_2025_predictions.csv`: Tabular output for analysis

## Model Summary

We use a hybrid approach for accuracy + engagement:

- Model Type: Random Forest Regressor (from `sklearn`)
- Training Data: FastF1 results from 2022–2024
- Features:
  - Grid position
  - Track-specific performance
  - Driver form (rolling 5-race average)
  - Team strength (recent trends)
  - Driver experience & special case handling
- Simulations: 1000 Monte Carlo runs per driver
- Extras: Heuristics for rookies, team changes, rain risk, Suzuka experts

## For Non-Technical Readers (Reddit, IG, Twitter)

You don’t need to understand code to enjoy this:

- We’re using past F1 data to predict who finishes where in future races.
- We simulate 1,000 races based on real qualifying data, driver history, team performance, and random events like crashes or rain.
- The charts help show how confident we are in each prediction (e.g. Verstappen might win, but is he 90% likely or 55%?).
- Think of it as fantasy F1 meets data science.

---

## Built With

- `fastf1` for live/historical race data
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data processing
- `scikit-learn` for modeling
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pillow` for graphics
- Python 3.9+

---

## Contributions & Replication

We welcome forks and feedback! Try replicating predictions for other 2025 races by:

- Updating `drivers.py` with real qualifying results
- Switching the circuit name and location flags
- Running the script and sharing results
